# Game Design Document: Gorilla Arena

## Game Concept
A 3D third-person multiplayer battle between one powerful AI-controlled silverback gorilla and up to 100 human players. The game features a retro-inspired blocky aesthetic with low-poly models while maintaining an immersive and fun experience.

## Visual Style
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Low-poly, blocky models with a retro feel
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Vibrant, high-contrast colors
  - Jungle: Rich greens, browns, and earthy tones
  - Colosseum: Sandy beige, stone grays, and accent reds
- **Character Design**: 
  - Gorilla: Large, imposing blocky figure with distinctive silhouette
  - Human characters: 3 character classes with distinct silhouettes and color variations
- **Animation Style**: Simple but expressive animations that communicate action clearly
- **Lighting**: Dynamic lighting to create atmosphere and highlight important gameplay elements

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. Players join a lobby (public or custom)
2. Players select from 3 character classes (Tank, Scout, Balanced)
3. Game begins with players scattered across the environment
4. Players must work together to defeat the gorilla
5. The gorilla attempts to eliminate all human players
6. Round ends when either the gorilla is defeated or all humans are eliminated

## Game Mechanics

### Gorilla Mechanics
- **Health**: Extremely high health pool with visible health bar
- **Movement**: Powerful jumps, climbing, ground-pounding
- **Attacks**: 
  - Swipes: Wide arc damage
  - Charges: Line damage with knockback
  - Grabs: Single target high damage
  - Ground pound: Area of effect damage
- **Special Abilities**:

## Technical Considerations
- Built using Three.js for 3D rendering
- Optimized for handling 100+ characters simultaneously
- Low-poly assets to maintain performance
- Instancing for similar character models
- Level of detail (LOD) implementation for distance rendering
